## 题目描述
Search a 2D Matrix

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
For example,

Consider the following matrix:
```
[
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
```
Given target = 3, return true.

## 方法签名

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        
    }
}
```

## 思路
矩阵版的二分查找，思想还是一样，就是矩阵会让传参和计算更复杂
